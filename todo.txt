multi button hotkeys, for example
  mm for m/m, mf for m/f, so on
  sf for solo_focus, df for duo focus

save edit history
  useful for going back and seeing what you've changed
  would it be better to use localstorage or GM.setValue

apply tags on post load
  if a post already has say male when it is loaded
  highlight the male box, so users do not highlight it a second time
  could be bad because then they turn the rule off.
  but maybe make that not remove the rule.

get flash to work correctly
  I didn't find it worth my time to get it working well
  also do it for webm

allow blacklist
  I figure if you want to use this, you don't care about blacklist
  but someone will want this feature, because i hope this
  tool doesnt fall into obscurity
