# Quick Tagger

## This project is still very much a WIP, expect changes to be made that break things.

### [Install](https://github.com/Sasquire/quick_tagger/raw/master/distribution/main.user.js)
You must have some user script manager. [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en) has a good list. (I use tampermonkey). Greasemonkey does not work because they have [deprecated](https://github.com/sleeyax/ToledoPimper/issues/6) the `GM_` functions
